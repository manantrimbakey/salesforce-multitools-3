# ✨ Salesforce Multitools - Level Up Your SF Dev Game! ✨

No cap, this VS Code extension is BUSSIN' for Salesforce devs! Totally boosts your productivity and saves you from the struggle bus. 😎

## 🔥 What's The Vibe? 🔥

### 🚀 Component File Switcher - The Main Character

Sick of clicking through folders to find your Lightning component files? We fixed that!

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Smash `Alt+O` (or `Option+O` on Mac) - it's giving productivity
- **Sidebar UI**: Peep all your component files in one spot, no scrolling needed

#### How it slays:

When you're in your Lightning coding era:

1. Hit `Alt+O` (or `Option+O` on Mac) for the vibes
2. Files show up based on the hierarchy (we prioritize the important ones FR):
   - For LWC: JS file is the blueprint (main character energy), followed by HTML & CSS
   - For Aura: Controller.js is the GOAT, then the component file & CSS

#### The UI is *chef's kiss*

The sidebar be looking clean with:
- Component name & type with that LWC/Aura glow-up
- Files grouped by type 'cause we're organized queens 👑
- Unsaved files get that ✨special indicator✨
- Current file is highlighted so you know where you're at, no cap
